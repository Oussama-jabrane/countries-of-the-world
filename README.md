## - How to clone the repository onto your computer?

- First thing, you have to install git, Node.js. And npm or yarn.
- Then, you clone the repository onto your local machine using this command:

> git clone <https://github.com/Oussama-jabrane/countries-of-the-world>
- When the process is finished, you can open it with your favorite text editor or IDE.
- Then run this command on your terminal / cmd (And make sure that you are in the cloned folder).
- The install command for npm:

> npm install
- The install command for yarn

> yarn install
- To run the server you have to run this command:

> npm index
- Or:

> npm index.js
- Or you can simply type:

> npm .

Because in the package.json file, "index.js" is the default file in the folder.
